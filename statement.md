# Project Overview: Jarvis AI Assistant

## Problem Statement

Traditional computer interaction with a keyboard and mouse is inefficient for multitasking and inaccessible for users with physical limitations. This project aims to solve that by creating a hands-free, voice-controlled AI assistant to automate tasks.

## Scope of the Project

- **In Scope:** Voice recognition, application launching (Chrome, Spotify, VS Code), web searches (Google, Wikipedia), and providing time/date information.
- **Out of Scope:** Mobile support, smart home control, and complex conversational abilities.

## Target Users

- **Students & Developers** who want to work more efficiently.
- **Users with Physical Disabilities** who need hands-free computer access.
- **Multitaskers** who want to perform tasks without interrupting their workflow.

## High-Level Features

- **Voice Control**: Listen to commands and respond with a human-like voice.
- **App Launcher**: Open applications like Chrome, Spotify, and VS Code.
- **Web Automation**: Search Google, YouTube, and Wikipedia using voice.
- **Real-Time Info**: Announce the current time and date on request.
- **Smart Feedback**: Greet users based on the time of day and confirm actions.
